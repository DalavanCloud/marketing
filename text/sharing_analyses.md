# Use case: Sharing analyses

X has written some code, and used it to prepare and analyse her data. Now she wants her (advisor/collaborator)? to read it and comment on it, but she knows that Y's computer is not set up to run her code. She saves the notebook she was working on and converts it to HTML, which Y can view in any browser. This includes the code, notes X has written about what it does, and results in the form of graphs and tables.

After some time, Y wants to experiment with the code. He installs the software to run it, and X shares the notebook files with him. Now he can modify and rerun the code to see how it affects the results, and feed changes back to X.

If the analysis is public, they can share the notebook files on the web, and use the public NBViewer service to show people the code and results.
