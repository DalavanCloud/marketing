Joe is giving a lab meeting talk. He prepares presentation "slides" as IPython Notebooks, interleaving narrative text, images, LaTeX formulae, and code.  

He prepares code cells to load up some data and perform some  analysis.  Joe can execute the code cells, getting the results in-line in the same environment that he's writing the rest of the talk materials.

The first code cell loads the data. Another code cell which perform some analysis,  followed by a narrative cell that describes the method used, provides a rendered formula for the code implementation, suggests how some parameters might by altered, and provides clickable links to the paper which first introduced the technique. Yet another cell plots a subset of the data, so he can tweak the plotting parameters, such as line width and line color and re-execute again until getting a desirable result.  Joe and his advisor  expand the work into a full manuscript, with the notebook as the computational companion of the paper.

This practice has already been further extended to the scale of whole books:
