Stickers
--------

- uprinting.com: June 2014, ordered 3000 small square stickers (stickers, custom
  stickers, roll). Shape: square with rounded corners, size: 1"×1", material:
  white BOPP, coating: gloss indoor laminate.

- moo.com: ordered small square stickers (stickers, stickerbooks). These are
  7/8" square, glossy stickers, supplied in booklets of 90, six to a page.
  They are popular because they look like the stickers that come on computers
  (Intel inside etc.), but the design does slowly wear off on exposed surfaces
  like the outside of laptops and phones. It's also quite easy to give them out
  in sheets of six, which is more than most people will use.

- nextdayflyers.com: ordered 2"×3.5" stickers on matte stock, with no coating,
  and non-rounded corners. These come precut, making them easy to give out
  individually. We give away quite a few of them, though people don't seem as
  excited by them as by the smaller, shinier stickers.
